Description of abbreviations of measurements
Leading t or f is based on time or frequency measurements.

Body = related to body movement.
Gravity = acceleration of gravity
Acc = accelerometer measurement
Gyro = gyroscopic measurements
Jerk = sudden movement acceleration
Mag = magnitude of movement
mean and std (=standard deviation) are calculated for each subject for each activity for each mean and SD measurements.

Fields
ID Fields
1 subjectId - The participant ("subject") ID
2 activity - The label of the activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken. This variable covers 6 different activities:
WALKING (value 1): Subject was walking during the test.
WALKING_UPSTAIRS (value 2): subject was walking up a staircase during the test.
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (value 3): subject was walking down a staircase during the test.
SITTING (value 4): subject was sitting during the test.
STANDING (value 5): subject was standing during the test.
LAYING (value 6): subject was laying down during the test.
